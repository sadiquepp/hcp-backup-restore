# OADP: HCP control-plane backup/restore, including restore-to-new-hub

This directory used to hold static, hub1-only manifests. It's now driven
by `roles/setup-oadp/` plus three top-level playbooks, so the same flow
works for any hosted cluster (`hcp-cluster1`, `hcp-cluster2`, ...) and for
restoring onto a replacement hub (`hub2`) after a DR cutover
(`shutdown_hub_cluster.yaml` / `setup_hub_cluster2.yaml`).

The OADP operator itself is installed as part of hub bring-up, by
`roles/setup-hub-acm` (right alongside ACM/LVM-Storage/MetalLB) - see
`roles/setup-hub-acm/files/oadp/`. So it's already present on both hub1
and hub2 by the time you get here; `roles/setup-oadp/` only wires up the
cloud-credentials secret and the DataProtectionApplication, which need
AWS credentials/a bucket that don't exist at first hub bring-up.

`hello-openshift*.yaml` are left as-is - a small, self-contained
smoke-test app + Backup/Restore pair to sanity-check OADP itself before
you run it against a real hosted cluster.

## One-time AWS setup (per bucket, not per hub)

```bash
export BUCKET=adp-backup-bucket-xjtvvs   # must be globally unique - pick your own
export REGION=ap-south-1

aws s3api create-bucket --bucket $BUCKET --region $REGION \
  --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=$REGION

aws iam create-user --user-name adp-user
aws iam put-user-policy --user-name adp-user --policy-name adp-policy --policy-document file://adp-policy.json
aws iam create-access-key --user-name adp-user
```

Set `oadp_bucket_name` and `oadp_aws_region` in `vars.yaml` to match, and
add the access key from the last command to `vault.yaml`:

```bash
ansible-vault edit vault.yaml
```
```yaml
oadp_aws_access_key_id: 'AKIA...'
oadp_aws_secret_access_key: '...'
```

This bucket and IAM user are reused by both hub1 and hub2 - you only do
this section once per lab, not once per hub.

## Primary Hub: 
### Configure OADP (credentials + DPA)
The operator is already there (installed during hub bring-up). This
step just points it at your bucket:

```bash
ansible-playbook setup_oadp.yaml --ask-vault-pass
```

Idempotent - re-running against the same hub just reconciles the
secret/DPA. Both hubs point at the same bucket/prefix, so hub2's Velero
can see backups hub1 created.

### Deploy a hello-openshift application with a PVC to Hub Cluster and backup it using OADP.
This will be helpful to verify that the backup and restore process is working before running it against a hosted cluster.

```bash
oc apply -f oadp/hello-openshift-oadp.yaml
```

Write some persistent data to the PVC.

```bash
POD=`oc get pod -n hello-openshift-oadp -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}'`
oc exec -it $POD -n hello-openshift-oadp -- sh -c 'echo "Hello, World!" > /var/data/hello.txt'
```

Verify that the data is written to the PVC.

```bash
oc exec -it $POD -n hello-openshift-oadp -- sh -c 'cat /var/data/hello.txt'
```

Backup the hello-openshift application with a PVC using OADP.
```bash
oc apply -f oadp/hello-openshift-oadp-backup.yaml
```

### Backup a hosted cluster using OADP.

```bash
ansible-playbook backup_hosted_cluster.yaml --ask-vault-pass \
  -e hcp_cluster_name=hcp-cluster1
```

`hcp_cluster_name` must match the HostedCluster's name/namespace - it's
used to derive both the hosting namespace and the HyperShift
control-plane namespace (`<name>-<name>`). Works unchanged for
`hcp-cluster2` or any future hosted cluster.

### Shutdown Primary Hub

```bash
ansible-playbook shutdown_hub_cluster.yaml --ask-vault-pass
```
## DR Hub:
### Build Replacement Hub
Once the primary hub is shutdown, you can build the DR hub.
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts setup_hub_cluster2.yaml --ask-vault-pass
```
Note that AgentServiceConfigs are not restored by OADP. You need to apply the rendered manifests manually before proceeding to the next step. Watch the ansible debug output for the location of the rendered manifests to apply.
```bash
oc apply -f /home/images/hcp-backup-restore/roles/setup-hub-acm/files/.rendered-05-agentserviceconfig.yaml
```
There is no need to create InfraEnv, HostedCluster and discover nodes. OADP will do that automatically.
### Configure OADP on DR Hub

```bash
ansible-playbook setup_oadp.yaml --ask-vault-pass -e target_hub=hub2
```
### Restore hello-openshift application with a PVC to DR Hub. This validated restore is working before restoring the hosted cluster.

```bash
oc apply -f oadp/hello-openshift-oadp-restore.yaml
```
Verify that the data persisted in the PVC is visible in the DR hub pod after restore.

```bash
POD=`oc get pod -n hello-openshift-oadp -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}'`
oc exec -it $POD -n hello-openshift-oadp -- sh -c 'cat /var/data/hello.txt'
```

### Restore the hosted cluster to the DR Hub using OADP. This will restore the hosted cluster to the DR Hub using OADP.

```bash
ansible-playbook restore_hosted_cluster.yaml --ask-vault-pass -e hcp_cluster_name=hcp-cluster1 -e target_hub=hub2
```
